  * DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 1.16
	* Fix to gosolnp for one parameter case thanks to
David Lawrence Miller.
  	* Fix to parallel gosolnp not passing multiple function
arguments (bug reported by Alex Karagiannis).
  	* rep argument in solnp.R had length rather than length.out (leading
  to cases name conflict).
	* Fix to pass new CRAN checks which only attach base.

	* DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 1.15
	* Fixes to pass 3.0.0

2012-12-05  Alexios Ghalanos <alexios@4dscape.com>
	* DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 1.14
	* Change to parallel functionality for gosolnp. Now makes use of the
	parallel package where the user has to pass an initialized cluster
	object (also fixes Windows paralllel functionality problems).

	* DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 1.12
	* Fix to .onLoad in zzz.R

2011-07-15  Alexios Ghalanos <alexios@4dscape.com>
	* DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 1.11
	* Added a penalty barrier function for use in the gosolnp random sampling and evaluation.
	* New function startpars directly returns a set of starting parameters ranked according
	to either a direct evaluation of the objective (excluding any inequality violations) else
	a penalty barrier function comprising the objective and constraints.

2011-07-06  Alexios Ghalanos <alexios@4dscape.com>
	* DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 1.1
	* Correction to bug when terminating without solution (introduced in last update).

2011-05-19  Alexios Ghalanos <alexios@4dscape.com>
	* DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 1.0-9
	* Added more traps to catch errors in inverting the hessian during the inner step.
	Convergence codes are now (0 - solution), (1 - maximum iterations without tolerance),
	(2 - no convergence, failure to invert Hessian).

	* DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 1.0-8
	* Parallel functionality changed in 'gosolnp' function to make use of both multicore and snowfall
	packages (i.e. windows multicore functionality now possible). This also opens the possibility for
	future extensions to use snowfall with Rmpi for cluster processing.

2010-10-01  Alexios Ghalanos <alexios@4dscape.com>

	* DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 1.0-7
	* Some additional clarification in the documentation on the control parameters.
	* Corrections to gosolnp checks on the inequality violations during random parameter generation
	in the case of one-dimensional constraints (thanks to Matthieu Stigler).
	* Convergence checks in the gosolnp with multiple restarts method to avoid exiting on failure from
	solnp.

2010-09-22  Alexios Ghalanos <alexios@4dscape.com>

	* DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 1.0-6
	* Correction to gosolnp bugs introduced in 1.0-5.
	* Parameter vector (pars) now retains names across calls to fun, eqfun and ineqfun
	(previously these were removed).

2010-09-03  Alexios Ghalanos <alexios@4dscape.com>

	* DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 1.0-5
	* Trace parameter was not correctly passed to gosolnp. Also minor
	corrections to trace parameter in solnp (i.e. warnings off).

2010-06-27  Alexios Ghalanos <alexios@4dscape.com>

	* DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 1.0-4
	* Corrections to subnp function when single parameter passed
	to solver (effectively added dimension arguments to 'diag'
	function when updating the Hessian).

2010-03-20  Alexios Ghalanos <alexios@4dscape.com>

	* DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 1.0-3
	* Corrections to documentation
